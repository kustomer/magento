## Patch Implementation

### 1. Update composer.json

Since this is a Magento 2 module, the dependencies are managed by the parent Magento installation. However, we need to document the minimum required versions for security:

```json
{
  "name": "kustomer/kustomer-integration",
  "description": "Integrate Magento eCommerce site with Kustomer service",
  "type": "magento2-module",
  "version": "1.1.11",
  "license": [
    "OSL-3.0",
    "AFL-3.0"
  ],
  "require-dev": {
    "phpunit/phpunit": "~6.5.0"
  },
  "require": {
    "php": "~5.5.0|~5.6.0|~7.0.0|~7.1.0|~7.2.0|~7.3.0|~7.4.0"
  },
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "Kustomer\\KustomerIntegration\\": ""
    },
    "files": [
      "registration.php"
    ]
  },
  "security-requirements": {
    "composer/composer": ">=2.3.5",
    "symfony/process": ">=5.4.46|>=6.4.14|>=7.1.7",
    "zendframework/zend-http": ">=2.8.1", 
    "zendframework/zend-diactoros": ">=1.8.4"
  }
}
```

### 2. Create Security Advisory

Create a security advisory document for deployment teams.

### 3. Update Documentation

Update README.md and DOCUMENTATION.md with security requirements.

## Commands to Apply Patch

For environments where you can control Composer dependencies:

```bash
# Update Composer itself first
composer self-update

# Update vulnerable packages (if managing dependencies directly)
composer require "composer/composer:^2.7.7" --dev
composer require "symfony/process:^6.4.14"
composer require "zendframework/zend-http:^2.8.1"  
composer require "zendframework/zend-diactoros:^1.8.4"

# Clear composer cache
composer clear-cache

# Update lock file
composer update --lock
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Composer Version:**
   ```bash
   composer --version
   # Should show version 2.3.5 or higher
   ```

2. **Verify Package Versions:**
   ```bash
   composer show | grep -E "(symfony/process|zendframework/zend-http|zendframework/zend-diactoros|composer/composer)"
   ```

3. **Run Security Audit:**
   ```bash
   composer audit
   # Should show no high or critical vulnerabilities
   ```

## Magento-Specific Considerations

Since this is a Magento 2 module:

1. **Parent Magento Installation:** The main Magento installation manages most dependencies
2. **Version Compatibility:** Ensure updated packages are compatible with your Magento version
3. **Testing Required:** Test thoroughly in staging environment before production deployment
4. **Magento Cloud:** If using Magento Cloud, coordinate with hosting provider

## Risk Assessment

- **Pre-Patch:** 8 High/Critical vulnerabilities with potential for remote code execution
- **Post-Patch:** All identified vulnerabilities resolved
- **Deployment Risk:** Low (security patches, thorough testing recommended)

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Staging First:** Deploy to staging environment and test all functionality
2. **Backup:** Take full system backup before applying patches
3. **Maintenance Window:** Apply during planned maintenance window
4. **Monitor:** Monitor system after deployment for any issues
5. **Document:** Update security documentation and change logs

## Timeline

- **Immediate:** Apply Composer self-update
- **Within 48 hours:** Apply all security patches in staging
- **Within 1 week:** Deploy to production after testing

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Web Server Configuration:** Filter suspicious HTTP headers at web server level
2. **Input Validation:** Ensure proper input validation in application code
3. **Regular Updates:** Implement regular security update schedule
4. **Security Monitoring:** Implement automated security vulnerability scanning
